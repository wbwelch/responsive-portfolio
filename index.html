					WB Welch has had her hand in everything. She worked for her college paper, interned at a law firm, wore many hats in the family dental practice…she rented a photo studio for a year, started her own natural skin care product line, was a certified personal trainer and corrective exercise specialist, and she is currently enrolled in a full-stack web development program. Thankfully, during all that time, she found her way back to fiction and is very happy to call herself a writer.

					Publishing credits include "Baby Muncher” in Thrice Fiction, Brenna’s Wing, along with her blog, readwbwelch.com. She holds a bachelor’s degree in journalism from Southern Methodist University.
